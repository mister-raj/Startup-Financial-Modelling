# Startup-Financial-Modelling

Intuition - This financial model serves as a strategic decision-making and fundraising tool for an startup. The model translates business assumptions into financial projections to answer three fundamental questions:

1. Is the business viable? → Through P&L, cash flow, and margin analysis
2. How much capital is needed? → Through working capital, capex, and funding gap analysis
3. What is the company worth? → Through DCF and market multiple valuation

🧠 Core Business Logic
The Business Model

Output Side & Input Side

The company makes money through product sales (revenue) and must carefully manage inventory, receivables, and payables—making working capital management the true operational heartbeat.

1. Assumptions Drive Everything
The entire model flows from the Assumption Sheet. Every revenue number, expense line, and balance sheet item traces back to a business assumption. This allows the user to ask "what if?" without breaking formulas.

2. Historical Data Informs Future Projections
FY18-20 data establishes baseline metrics:

Gross margins

Revenue growth rates

Customer acquisition patterns

Transaction behavior

3. Working Capital = The Silent Driver
The model captures:

Days before inventory converts to sale

Days before receivables convert to cash

Days before payables must be paid

This timing mismatch determines how much cash the business eats before it generates cash.

4. Two Valuation Lenses

DCF: "What is this business worth based on its ability to generate future cash?"

Market Multiples: "What are investors paying for similar companies today?"

5. Geography Matters
The model tracks customers across Rajasthan, Haryana, MP, UP, and Punjab. This reflects a distribution-led growth strategy—expand state by state rather than product by product.
